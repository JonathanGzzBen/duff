# duff
Duff is a Discord Bot written in TypeScript that has the features I wanted to add to my personal servers.

## Features
- Storing atomic codes for that **n** site (you know, that site)
- Greeting new server members
- Sending a "shut up" message for specified users when they send too many messages
